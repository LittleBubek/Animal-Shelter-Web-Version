# Animal-Shelter-Web-Version
This is a web version of the animal shelter management system connecting with H2 database.  
The project is not finished yet. For now it is possible to display the tables containing animals and people on a website. The tables are stored in a database. This is my first web apllication so it is very simple, but I am going to develop it.
